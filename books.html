            <strong>Book Name : </strong> 1984 <br>
            <strong>About the book : </strong>Among the seminal texts of the 20th century, Nineteen Eighty-Four is a rare work that grows more haunting as its
            futuristic purgatory becomes more real. Published in 1949, the book offers political satirist George Orwell's
            nightmarish vision of a totalitarian, bureaucratic world and one poor stiff's attempt to find individuality. The
            brilliance of the novel is Orwell's prescience of modern life--the ubiquity of television, the distortion of the
            language--and his ability to construct such a thorough version of hell. Required reading for students since it was
            published, it ranks among the most terrifying novels ever written.<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40961427-1984" target="_blank">Learn more.</a>
